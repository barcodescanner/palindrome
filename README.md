Palindrome webservice for Zillion

This was my "audition piece" when I interviewed at Zillion. It took me two days to write from scratch, but it was a very full two days.

It's a simple service that gets NASA patent holders' names from one of their REST APIs and uses the letters in their name to create a
palindrome (tacocat - same backwards and forwards). When I set this up live for my future manager to test, I ran it on an open Palm 
Pre using the linux core from WebOS. It was RADICAL, man.
