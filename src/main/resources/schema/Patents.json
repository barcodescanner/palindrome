      "abstract": "A photometer that tracks a path of a moving light source with little or     no motion of the photometer components. The system includes a non-moving,     truncated paraboloid of revolution, having a paraboloid axis, a     paraboloid axis, a small entrance aperture, a larger exit aperture and a     light-reflecting inner surface, that receives and reflects light in a     direction substantially parallel to the paraboloid axis. The system also     includes a light processing filter to receive and process the redirected     light, and to issue the processed, redirected light as processed light,     and an array of light receiving elements, at least one of which receives     and measures an associated intensity of a portion of the processed light.     The system tracks a light source moving along a path and produces a     corresponding curvilinear image of the light source path on the array of     light receiving elements. Undesired light wavelengths from the light     source may be removed by coating a selected portion of the reflecting     inner surface or another light receiving surface with a coating that     absorbs incident light in the undesired wavelength range.",

Pulses of laser light are directed to a measurement region of unseeded     gas to produce Rayleigh or Mie scattered light in a plurality of     directions. The Rayleigh or Mie scattered light is collected from     multiple directions and combined in a single collimated light beam. The     Rayleigh or Mie scattered light is then mixed together with a reference     laser light before it is passed through a single planar Fabry-Perot     interferometer for spectral analysis. At the output of the     interferometer, a high-sensitivity CCD camera images the interference     fringe pattern. This pattern contains the spectral and spatial     information from both the Rayleigh scattered light and the reference     laser light. Interferogram processing software extracts and analyzes     spectral profiles to determine the velocity components of the gas flow at     multiple points in the measurement region. The Rayleigh light rejected by     the interferometer is recirculated to increase the accuracy and the     applicability of the method for measurements at high temperatures without     requiring an increase in the laser energy.",

      "abstract": "A plant chlorophyll content meter is described which collects light     reflected from a target plant and separates the collected light into two     different wavelength bands. These wavelength bands, or channels, are     described as having center wavelengths of 700 nm and 840 nm. The light     collected in these two channels are processed using photo detectors and     amplifiers. An analog to digital converter is described which provides a     digital representation of the level of light collected by the lens and     falling within the two channels. A controller provided in the meter device     compares the level of light reflected from a target plant with a level of     light detected from a light source, such as light reflected by a target     having 100% reflectance, or transmitted through a diffusion receptor. The     percent of reflection in the two separate wavelength bands from a target     plant are compared to provide a ratio which indicates a relative level of     plant physiological stress. A method of compensating for electronic drift     is described where a sample is taken when a collection lens is covered to     prevent light from entering the device. This compensation method allows     for a more accurate reading by reducing error contributions due to     electronic drift from environmental conditions at the location where a     hand-held unit is used.",

An electro-optical layer of     the grating assembly may be electrically connected to an energy supply to     change the refractive index of the electro-optical layer. Alternately,     the gratings may be electrically connected to the energy supply and     energized, e.g., with alternating voltages, to change the refractive     index. A data recorder may record the predetermined spectral     characteristic. A method of detecting a spectral characteristic of a     predetermined wavelength of source light includes generating collimated     light using an optical assembly, directing the collimated light onto the     micro-ring grating assembly, and selectively energizing the micro-ring     grating assembly to diffract the predetermined wavelength onto the target     focal point, and detecting the spectral characteristic using a photon     detector.",

As     a near perfect single crystal material, single crystal silicon has much     lower internal stress than a conventional material.

After being ground and polished, a single crystal silicon mirror is light     weighted by removing material from the back side using ultrasonic     machining. After the light weighting process, the single crystal silicon     mirror may be used as-is or further figured by conventional polishing or     ion milling, depending on the application and the operating wavelength.",

      "abstract": "An afocal monolithic optical element formed of a shallow cylinder of     optical material (glass, polymer, etc.) with fast aspheric surfaces,     nominally confocal paraboloids, configured on the front and back     surfaces. The front surface is substantially planar, and this lends     itself to deposition of multi-layer stacks of thin dielectric and metal     films to create a filter for rejecting out-of-band light. However, an     aspheric section (for example, a paraboloid) can either be ground into a     small area of this surface (for a Cassegrain-type telescope) or attached     to the planar surface (for a Gregorian-type telescope). This aspheric     section of the surface is then silvered to create the telescope's     secondary mirror. The rear surface of the cylinder is figured into a     steep, convex asphere (again, a paraboloid in the examples), and also     made reflective to form the telescope's primary mirror. A small section     of the rear surface (approximately the size of the secondary obscuration,     depending on the required field of the telescope) is ground flat to     provide an unpowered surface through which the collimated light beam can     exit the optical element. This portion of the rear surface is made to     transmit the light concentrated by the reflective surfaces, and can     support the deposition of a spectral filter.",

      "abstract": "An optical apparatus includes an optical diffraction device configured     for diffracting a predetermined wavelength of incident light onto     adjacent optical focal points, and a photon detector for detecting a     spectral characteristic of the predetermined wavelength. One of the     optical focal points is a constructive interference point and the other     optical focal point is a destructive interference point. The diffraction     device, which may be a micro-zone plate (MZP) of micro-ring gratings or     an optical lens, generates a constructive ray point using     phase-contrasting of the destructive interference point. The ray point is     located between adjacent optical focal points. A method of generating a     densely-accumulated ray point includes directing incident light onto the     optical diffraction device, diffracting the selected wavelength onto the     constructive interference focal point and the destructive interference     focal point, and generating the densely-accumulated ray point in a narrow     region.",

      "abstract": "--AS FILED IN APPLICATION--\nThe present invention comprises an approach for calibrating the sensitivity to polarization, optics degradation, spectral and stray light response functions of instruments on orbit. The concept is based on using an accurate ground-based laser system, Ground-to-Space Laser Calibration (GSLC), transmitting laser light to instrument on orbit during nighttime substantially clear-sky conditions. To minimize atmospheric contribution to the calibration uncertainty the calibration cycles should be performed in short time intervals, and all required measurements are designed to be relative. The calibration cycles involve ground operations with laser beam polarization and wavelength changes.",

The SWCNT can be replaced by other types of nanotubes.  The SWCNT film can be obtained by filtering SWCNT solution onto the surface of an anodized alumina membrane.  A freestanding flexible SWCNT film can be collected by breaking up this brittle membrane.  The conductivity of this SWCNT film can advantageously be higher than 280 S/cm.  An electroactive polymer (EAP) actuator layered with the SWNT-FE shows a higher electric field-induced strain than an EAP layered with metal electrodes because the flexible SWNT-FE relieves the restraint of the displacement of the polymeric active layer as compared to the metal electrode.  In addition, if thin enough, the SWNT-FE is transparent in the visible light range, thus making it suitable for use in actuators used in optical devices.",

The microchannel     electron generator comprises one or more microchannel plates (MCPs), Each     MCP comprises a honeycomb assembly of a plurality of annular components,     which may be stacked to increase electron intensity. The multichannel     electron generator used enables directional control of electron flow. In     addition, the multichannel electron generator used is more robust than     conventional filaments, making the resulting X-ray tube very shock and     vibration resistant.",

First and second isotopes of an element are co-located     within the linear ion trap. The first isotope has a resonant microwave     transition between two hyperfine energy states, and the second isotope     has a resonant Zeeman transition. Optical sources emit ultraviolet light     that optically pump both isotopes. A microwave radiation source     simultaneously emits microwave fields resonant with the first isotope's     clock transition and the second isotope's Zeeman transition, and an     optical detector measures the fluorescence from optically pumping both     isotopes. The second isotope's Zeeman transition provides the measure of     magnetic field strength, and the measurement is used to compensate the     first isotope's clock transition or to adjust the applied C-field to     reduce the effects of ambient magnetic field perturbations.",

A     series of relatively short and low current monitor pulses are applied to     the laser diode in the period between the main drive current pulses     necessary to cause the semiconductor to lase. At the sufficiently low     current level of the monitor pulses, the laser diode device does not lase     and behaves similar to an electronic diode. The voltage across the laser     diode resulting from each of these low current monitor pulses is measured     with a high degree of precision. The junction temperature is then     determined from the measured junction voltage using their known linear     relationship.",

Optical energy of a     selected wavelength is generated at a source and directed along N     reference optical paths having N reference path lengths. Each reference     optical path terminates in one of N detectors such that N reference     signals are produced at the N detectors. The reference signals are     indicative of amplitude, phase and frequency of the optical energy carried     along the N reference optical paths. The optical energy from the source is     also directed to the N-ports of the guided wave device and then on to each     of the N detectors such that N measurement optical paths are defined     between the source and each of the N detectors. A portion of the optical     energy is modified in terms of at least one of the amplitude and phase to     produce N modified signals at each of the N detectors. At each of the N     detectors, each of the N modified signals is combined with a corresponding     one of the N reference signals to produce corresponding N combined signals     at each of the N detectors. A total of N.sup.2 measurement signals are     generated by the N detectors. Each of the N.sup.2 measurement signals is     sampled at a wave number increment .DELTA.k so that N.sup.2 sampled     signals are produced. The N.times.N transfer function elements are     generated using the N.sup.2 sampled signals. Reference and measurement     path length constraints are defined such that the N combined signals at     each of the N detectors are spatially separated from one another in the     time domain.",

Recently I received a request from SPIE newsroom ( http://newsroom.spie.org) to write an article about this technology for online publication. It seems it is beginning to generate some interest in the science community.\nSPIE Newsroom, which I received the request from, is a new kind of online technology news service. Its technical content is designed to complement that of archival journals and proceedings on one hand and conventional science journalism on the other. The aim is to allow ideas to propagate widely through the technical community, allowing cross-fertilization of disciplines, by making them accessible.\n\nGiven the status of the patent disclosure, we are unsure how to proceed at this point and are hesitant to publish or to field inquiries about this technology until the decision on the patent is finalized. Could you inform us at the earliest convenience regarding the current status of Case No. LAR-17547-1.\n\nThank You,\nBrian\n"
