The system includes a non-moving,     truncated paraboloid of revolution, having a paraboloid axis, a     paraboloid axis, a small entrance aperture, a larger exit aperture and a     light-reflecting inner surface, that receives and reflects light in a     direction substantially parallel to the paraboloid axis. The system also     includes a light processing filter to receive and process the redirected     light, and to issue the processed, redirected light as processed light,     and an array of light receiving elements, at least one of which receives     and measures an associated intensity of a portion of the processed light.     The system tracks a light source moving along a path and produces a     corresponding curvilinear image of the light source path on the array of     light receiving elements. Undesired light wavelengths from the light     source may be removed by coating a selected portion of the reflecting     inner surface or another light receiving surface with a coating that     absorbs incident light in the undesired wavelength range.",

Pulses of laser light are directed to a measurement region of unseeded     gas to produce Rayleigh or Mie scattered light in a plurality of     directions. The Rayleigh or Mie scattered light is collected from     multiple directions and combined in a single collimated light beam. The     Rayleigh or Mie scattered light is then mixed together with a reference     laser light before it is passed through a single planar Fabry-Perot     interferometer for spectral analysis. At the output of the     interferometer, a high-sensitivity CCD camera images the interference     fringe pattern. This pattern contains the spectral and spatial     information from both the Rayleigh scattered light and the reference     laser light. Interferogram processing software extracts and analyzes     spectral profiles to determine the velocity components of the gas flow at     multiple points in the measurement region. The Rayleigh light rejected by     the interferometer is recirculated to increase the accuracy and the     applicability of the method for measurements at high temperatures without     requiring an increase in the laser energy.",
